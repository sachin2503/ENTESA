                    At the SIGMA ,there were mechatronics 
                    machine such as pneumatic actuator , 
                    hydraulic actuator and different types
                    of sensors were present. At Pawana Dam
                    students get the knowledge of how to 
                    generate energy that is electricity
                    from water and relative components.
                    After visiting this places our students
                    gain to more practical 
                    knowledge about hardware and machineries.
